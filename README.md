# Machine-Learning-Kaggle

First, what do all the files correspond to:
- test and train are the data. Train is the data with the __true predictions__ given to train our model. While Test we don't have the predicted values.
- 11_TAUCH_ASSADI.csv are the __predicted values returned__ from the data test.
- Kaggle.Rmd is the __program file__ so program in __RMarkdown__
- [Download and Save this in your files to see the rendering with code and interpretation](kaggle.html) is the __visible html__ rendering to __save in your files__ to view

## Load data 

we import the file and manipulate the data.

Transform Data / Split Data / Scale Data...

## PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

The Principal Component Analysis is a popular unsupervised learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It increases interpretability yet, at the same time, it minimizes information loss. It helps to find the most significant features in a dataset and makes the data easy for plotting in 2D and 3D.

See the code for the whole PCA study of our dataset between variables and individuals.

## 1st method Multiple Logistic Regression Mode

we use __glm()__ to do the regression's model 

## 2nd method BAGGING

## 3rd method RANDOM FOREST

## 4th method BOOSTING GBM

## Matrix Confusion
